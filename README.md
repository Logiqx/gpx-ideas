## GPX Ideas

This project contains my thoughts and proposals for the GPX standard - extensions, schemas, etc.

The contents of this project are likely to be quite fluid as it is to capture my Cideas and thoughts.

My approach is "commit often, perfect later, publish once" so you should regard everything as WIP - [link](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/)

All of the latest documentation is available on [GitHub pages](https://logiqx.github.io/gpx-ideas/).
