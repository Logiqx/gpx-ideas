### Doppler Speed

#### Garmin Devices

Many early Garmin devices used the [SiRF Star III](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/SiRFstar_III) which calculates speed using the Dopper method, but the devices did not save COG or SOG to their logs:

- Garmin Edge 305 / 705 - circa 2005-2006
- Garmin Forerunner 205 / 305 - circa 2006-2008
  - The [manual](https://www.gpscity.com/pdfs/manuals/FRUN205-EN-MANUAL.pdf) also appears to quote stats from SiRF's product spec:
    - "GPS velocity accuracy < 0.05 m/s"
- Garmin GPSMap 60Cx / 60CSx / 76Cx / 76CSx - circa 2005-2006
- TomTom Go 510 - circa 2006



As an aside, Garmin started supporting GPX in handheld devices (Nuvi) around 2006, and MapSource around 2004 - [link](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#g8uv4i+5rs9@eGroups.com)
