## GPX Landscape

### What's Changed?

- Speed and course are routinely available now
  - n.b. Course and speed were not recorded in Garmin tracklogs for a long time - see [post](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#fl9inu+s6eu@eGroups.com)
    - "The actual tracklog is stored in the "active log" and contains x, y, z, and timestamps."
    - eTrex 2 could record 2,047 points, Forerunner 201 was 3,000 and 301 was 5,000
      - Newer eTrex / Foretrex and Geko were 10,000 points - pretty common figure for Garmin at the time
      - Subsequent models using SiRF Star III
        - Garmin Edge 305 / 705 - circa 2005-2006
          - 13,000 (3.5 h) / 16383 (4.5 h) points respectively
        - Garmin Forerunner 205 / 305 - circa 2006-2008
          - 13,000 points (3.5 h)
        - Garmin GPSMap 60Cx / 60CSx / 76Cx / 76CSx - circa 2005-2006
      - Used to exhibit a 2.4 m "grid effect"
      - I've got tracks like these from G7ToWin from 2007 to 2010 - mainly eTrex or Forerunner 205
  - Connect - 2011, Fenix - 2013, Fenix 2 - 2014, Fenix 3 - 2016
  - Nowadays there are many incompatible ways of storing it in GPX, or simply omitting it
- EXIF
  - [GPS tags](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/GPS.html) - includes speed (SOG), track (COG) and HPositioningError
- Smartphones
  - See [post](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#pbpm9p+l5v29i@YahooGroups.com) by Harmen Warringa
  - APIs including speed, course and accuracy estimates
  - Abundance of apps which support GPX
- Fitness watches are common-place
  - HR, step counters
- Sailing devices
  - Sailmon
- Common data in FIT files
  - hr, cadence, distance
