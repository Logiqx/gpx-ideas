## GPX Developers Mailing List and GPSXML Archive

### Background

These pages are essentially private notes that I made whilst reviewing the archived messages of the [GPSXML](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp) mailing list.

Since the archive contains almost 20 years worth of discussion, I tried to keed notes of things that may (or may not) be relevant.

Disclaimer: These notes are by no means be a definitive list of important topics that were discussed on the GPSXML mailing list.

- Garmin responses - FYI

  - Second response from Garmin offered their extensions - [link](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#hi0dp8+740i@eGroups.com)
  - Third response from Garmin suggested an extension schema for 1.1 and a new 1.2
  - Final response from Garmin was that it was unlikely they'd adopt it - [link](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#hiitni+a64o@eGroups.com)
  - Summary in Apr 2018 talks about several vendors making contact privately, presumably back in 2010 - [link](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#CAGJ6+wq4Pp9d2Qb-YVmkPtkG-h_sOiqR6d=PEpR-rinLuQ6T_Q@mail.gmail.com)
