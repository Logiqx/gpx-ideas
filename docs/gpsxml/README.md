## GPX Developers Mailing List and GPSXML Archive

### Background

These pages are essentially some notes that I made whilst reviewing the archived messages of the [GPSXML](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp) mailing list.

Since the archive contains almost 20 years worth of discussions, I tried to keep track of things that may (or may not) be relevant now.

Disclaimer: These notes are by no means be a definitive list of important topics that were discussed on the GPSXML mailing list.
