## GPX Ideas

### History

There was talk about a GPX 2.0 a couple of times, which would be much lighter than 1.2 and use addon schemas.

  - "It is my opinion that GPX already has too much stuff in it. I'd like to see GPX 2.0 made lighter and new add-on schemas developed for related uses."

  - "I would like to see a dozen or so officially-blessed extension schemas created to extend the base GPX 2.0 schema in different directions. I'd like to see a commitment from developers using the GPX format to develop common "officially-blessed" schemas for data that might have a use in other hardware or software applications, and to only use private schemas for truly private data that has no meaning outside of that developer's application."

  - "Maybe the solution isn't a new GPX, but some sort of standard library of extensions.  I have a pretty decent (in my opinion) GPX extension schema for aviation waypoint data, and I'd be really disappointed if somebody who needed similar but slightly different data would design their own extension schema instead of cooperating with me to extend mine."

  - "I'm reluctant to turn GPX into the kitchen sink.  Ask a runner and a sailor what's important to each of them and they'll give opposite answers and then declare the other half as "obvious bloat", much as you just did."
  - "I'm liking the small core kernel of GPX, a blessed set of extensions for the things that are common now (direction and tilt, temperature, etc.), and the use of the `<extensions>` tag for domain-specific problems that can be integrated into "blessed" status once they get enough exposure to be proven to be workable and useful."

  - "Once those extensions have been implemented by enough programs to be proven useful, they can be frozen in future versions of GPX itself."

  - "It seems a pretty natural progression: experimental->one program->several programs->a proposed GPX extension->a holy GPX extension->official GPX."
