    <desc>The Lobster Pot has been at the heart of the iconic Portland Bill since the late 1940â€™s in one form or another, and is still owned by the same family, now in the third generation. It is very much a part of the local community, and many Portlanders (and Kimberlins!*) have either worked at The Lobster Pot, are regular customers with their families, or indeed both.</desc>
