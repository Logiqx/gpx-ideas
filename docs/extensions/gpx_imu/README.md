### Inertial Measurement Unit  - gpx_imu

#### Overview

Heading (yaw) and attitude (pitch and roll) from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is relevant to a huge number of activities; land, sea and air.


| Name      | Values       | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<hdg>`   | 0 to 360     | Heading (HDG) is the direction in which an object is pointed, relative to true north in degrees (째). Heading and yaw are synonymous but sailors and pilots will always refer to yaw as heading. See THS, [HDT](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_hdt_heading_true), [HDG](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_hdg_heading_deviation_variation) and [VHW](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_vhw_water_speed_and_heading) in NMEA 0183 |
| `<pitch>` | -90 to +90   | Pitch is the up / down rotation of an object about its transverse / y axis in degrees (째).  Sailors will sometimes refer to pitch as "trim" |
| `<roll>`  | -180 to +180 | Roll is the side-to-side rotation of an object about its longitudinal / x axis in degrees (째). Sailors refer to roll as "heel", whereas pilots refer to it as "bank". A value greater than 90 degrees indicates an inversion of the vessel / aircraft. |
| `<stat>`  | 0 or 1       | INS status flag. 0 = SPAN pre-alignment INS status, 1 = SPAN post-alignment INS status |
| `<rot>`   |              | Rate of turn (ROT) is the rate of change of heading, measured in degrees per minute (째/min). A positive number means turning clockwise and negative number means turning counter-clockwise. ROT is most relevant to ships and aircraft where it is a measure of how fast the vessel / aircraft is turning. See [ROT](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_rot_rate_of_turn) in NMEA 0183 |

Accuracy estimates for heading, roll and pitch can be provided using the "acc" attribute.

| Name              | Values   | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<hdg acc="n">`   | 0 to 180 | Heading accuracy / error estimate in degrees, such that the difference between the true yaw and the reported yaw is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |
| `<roll acc="n">`  | 0 to 180 | Roll accuracy / error estimate in degrees, such that the difference between the true roll and the reported roll is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |
| `<pitch acc="n">` | 0 to 90  | Pitch accuracy / error estimate in degrees, such that the difference between the true pitch and the reported pitch is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |



#### Notes

- The standard abbreviation for heading is HDG in nautical and aviation environments, hence the naming of `<hdg>` in this schema
  - The words heading and yaw are synonymous. However, yaw values are sometimes -180 to 180, so heading = (yaw + 360) % 360
  - The aviation industry (worldwide) is currently preparing to switch from magnetic north to true north - [Mag2True](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/time-for-a-change-of-direction)
- The availability of accuracy / error estimates is largely due to the use of a Kalman filter within the IMU



#### Exclusions

- Instantaneous heave (up / down), sway (left / right) and surge (front / back)
  - Instantaneous heave is sometimes calculated in GNSS + INS solutions, but not sway or surge?
