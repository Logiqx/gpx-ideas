#### Overview

The engine elements listed below are important to motor vehicles, yachts, boats, planes, and helicopters.

| Name            | Values   | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tach id="n"     | >= 0     | Tachometer for engine / rotor / propeller for revolutions per minute (RPM). See [RPM](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_rpm_revolutions) in NMEA 0183 - only record when status "A" |
| trim id="n"     | 0 to 100 | Propeller pitch as a percentage of the maximum (%). See [RPM](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_rpm_revolutions) in NMEA 0183 - only record when status "A" |
| torq id="n"     | >= 0     | Torque from engine in Newton metres (Nm)                     |
| temp id="n"     |          | Temperature of cylinder head / exhaust gas / carburetor / oil / coolant in degrees centigrade (Â° C) |
| pressure id="n" | >= 0     | Pressure for boost / vacuum / oil / coolant / fuel in kilopascals (kPa) |
| level id="n"    | >= 0     | Amount of fuel / oil in litres (L)                           |
| volts id="n"    | >= 0     | Battery level in volts (V)                                   |
| amps id="n"     | >= 0     | Battery current which may be negative (charging) or positive (discharging) in amps (A) |



#### Notes

All of these engine measurements may result in multiple values for a single moment in time, which is why elements have an "id" attribute.

- `<tach>` might be required for boats with twin outboard motors
- `<temp>` might be required for oil temperature and coolant temperature
- `<level>` might be required for port and starboard fuel tanks

Sources for each "id" are optional, but if provided would be in elements such as `<gpx>`, `<trk>` or `<trkseg>`, much like in the [gpx_fit](../gpx_fit/README.md) examples.
