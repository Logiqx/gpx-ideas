#### Random Notes - UNEDITED

Notes:

- wind direction + speed use their nautical names, signifying "wind over ground" or "ground wind" (GWD + GWS)
- dew point is included, because it can be directly measured (or calculated from air temperature and relative humidity) - TODO link

Unnecessary:

- wind chill is not included because it is calculated from the air temperature and wind speed - TODO link
- heat index is not included, because it is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity - TODO link
