## GPX Extensions

### Overview

Some of this content is nothing more than my working notes and therefore require some serious editing!

I'd recommend looking at some of the examples first, prior to looking at my unedited working notes.

- General [approach](approach.md) - **unedited** working notes relating to GPX extensions / usage / core
- Proposed [extensions](extensions.md) - **unedited** working notes that need concise writeups
- Practical [examples](examples/README.md) - various activities for land, sea, and air
