## GPX Extensions

### Overview

Some of this content is nothing more than my working notes and therefore require some serious editing!

I'd recommend looking at some of the examples first, prior to looking at my unedited working notes.

- General [approach](approach.md) - **unedited** working notes relating to GPX extensions / usage / core
- Proposed [extensions](extensions.md) - summary of each extension with links to some use-cases / examples
- Practical [examples](examples/README.md) - examples for various activities; land, sea, and air
