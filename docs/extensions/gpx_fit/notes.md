#### Random Notes - UNEDITED

- Cadence
  - Cyclists sometimes call it "pedalling rate" , measured in rpm.
    - It's the number of revolutions the pedals make per minute
    - Not to be confused with the rotational rate of the wheel
  - Runners call it "stride rate", measured in steps per minute
    - Just for clarity, it is the number of single steps per minute
  - Swimmers call it "stroke rate", measured in strokes per minute
    - Just for clarity, it is the number of single strokes per minute
- Reps
  - Steps
  - Strokes
  - Jumps
- Elevation gain is included to avoid cumulative errors
- Energy is included to avoid the cumulative errors that might occur when converting from power
  - n.b. Power and energy can be monitored / updated more frequently than the typical 1 second GNSS interval
- Cadence may not seem necessary for walking but it can be updated more accurately when the exact timing of steps is known
- Bike computers track hr, cad, power, kcal
- Aside from "steps", counting something for a whole session does not occur in many sports:
  - Cyclists only tend to count revolutions of the pedals for about 15 or 20 seconds - [link](https://coachlevi.com/cycling/how-to-count-your-cadence/)
  - Swimmers only tend to count strokes for one or two lengths of the pool - [link](https://www.yourswimlog.com/swolf-swimming/)
  - TBC - should it be a generic "reps" for teps (walking), strokes (rowing), jumps (skipping) or hops (pogo stick)

Elsewhere

- Revolutions per minute (RPM) of bike wheel - use tachometer in the generic extension (gpx_gen)
