### Position / Velocity / Time - gpx_pvt

#### Random Notes - UNEDITED

Separate accuracy estimates have been superseded by the "acc" attribute.

| Name     | Values | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<hacc>` | >= 0   | Horizontal accuracy / error estimate in meters, such that the difference between the true horizontal position and the reported horizontal position is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed.<br />TODO - list NMEA sentences |
| `<vacc>` | >= 0   | Vertical accuracy / error estimate in meters, such that the difference between the true vertical position and the reported vertical position is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed.<br />TODO - list NMEA sentences |



##### Velocity


Separate accuracy estimates have been superseded by the "acc" attribute.

| Name      | Values   | Description                                                  |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<cacc>`  | 0 to 180 | Course over ground (COG) accuracy / error estimate in degrees, such that the difference between the true COG and the reported COG is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |
| `<sacc>`  | >= 0     | Speed over ground (SOG) accuracy / error estimate in m/s, such that the difference between the true SOG and the reported SOG is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |
| `<vsacc>` | >= 0     | Vertical speed accuracy / error estimate in m/s, such that the difference between the true ROC and the reported ROC is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |

- COG
  - Sometimes referred to as course over ground (COG) or course made good (CMG)
  - Sometimes referred to track or track made good (TMG)

See [article](https://www.sailingissues.com/navcourse4.html) about naming of COG, SOG, etc.

- COG is not the same as heading - consider sailing, flying, and car drifting

- Subtleties
  - COG is not quite the same as CMG / TMG which are both over a longer period of time
    - Planes may refer to COG as "track" though?
  - SOG is not the quite same as SMG which is over a longer period of time
  
- COG + SOG - sensors other than GNSS
  - SOG can sometimes be generated by alternative means, such as a bicycle wheel sensor, or GNSS + INS solution
  - COG can be derived from a compass when on land, but not when in the sea / air because "heading" and COG are different
  



##### Time

Separate accuracy estimates have been superseded by the "acc" attribute.

| Name     | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<tacc>` | Time accuracy / error estimate in seconds (including milliseconds), such that the difference between the true time and the reported time is less than the accuracy / error estimate 68% of the time. 68% corresponds to 1-sigma of a normal distribution, but this does not imply that errors are independent or normally distributed. |
