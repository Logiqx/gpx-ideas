## General Usage

All of the topics listed in this document apply to multiple versions of GPX - currently GPX 1.0 and GPX 1.1.

They are essentially standardisation / documentation activities.



### Compressed Files

Document file compression (GPZ) for GPX 1.0 / 1.1 / 1.2.

- Essentially mimics the KMZ format of KML

- This idea was supported by Dan Foster, Robert Lipe, Jeremy Irish and numerous other people



### Embedded Icons, Images, Photos, Videos

- "We do need to come up with some answers as to how GPX should handle things like photos embedded in waypoints, waypoints embedded in photos, and your hotspots and other map symbols." - see [link](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_mailing_list.asp#885169760.20060825161206@topografix.com)
- This ties in particularly well with compression files (GPZ) where multiple files can be bundled together
- However, use of relative paths may have some issues as described in the possible [improvements](../core/README.md) to the GPX core



### Schema endpoints - HTTPS support
