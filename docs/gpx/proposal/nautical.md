## Proposal for GPX

### Nautical Elements

Nautical and aeronautical elements have been suggested.

| Name    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| heading | Vessel heading, differs from course made good due to effects of wind and water current. |

Wind and water data is listed in a separate [weather and water](weather.md) document.



#### TODO

- Engine speed or RPM, or whatever the boating and aviation community uses as their equivalent of a car's speedometer. (differs from speed made good due to wind or water speed or tire slippage).

- Need to review [NMEA 2000 data types](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-1415AAD0-FE63-42A6-8F8D-DB713D616122/EN-US/GUID-FACE3DF9-D18C-43B2-A586-B14F670077E1.html).
