## Proposal for GPX

### Weather, Wind and Water Elements

Weather, wind and water elements have been suggested.

| element | Description       |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| atemp   | Air temperature   |
| depth   | Depth             |
| wtemp   | Water temperature |



#### TODO

- Beyond atemp, depth and wtemp there are many weather, wind and water elements to be considered.
- Need to review [NMEA 2000 data types](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-1415AAD0-FE63-42A6-8F8D-DB713D616122/EN-US/GUID-FACE3DF9-D18C-43B2-A586-B14F670077E1.html) for wind/water speed/direction sensors for boating and aviation.
