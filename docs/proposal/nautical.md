## Proposal for GPX

### Nautical and Aeronautical

Nautical and aeronautical elements have been suggested.

| Name    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| aspeed  | Air speed is the speed of an aircraft relative to the air in meters per second (m/s) |
| drift   | Speed of the water / current in meters per second (m/s)      |
| heading | Direction in which the nose or bow is pointed, relative to true north in degrees (째) |
| pitch   | Fore / aft rotation of an aircraft or vessel (trim) about its transverse axis in degrees (째) |
| roll    | Tilting of an aircraft or vessel (heel) about its longitudinal axis in degrees (째) |
| set     | Direction of the water / current, relative to true north in degrees (째) |
| wdist   | Total distance through the water in meters (m) |
| wspeed  | Water speed / boat speed is the speed of a vessel through the water in meters per second (m/s) |

Omissions:

- There is no need for velocity made good (VMG) since it is derived from speed over ground (SOG) and true wind direction (TWD)
- This list ignores NMEA trawler data such as [TDS](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tds_trawl_door_spread_distance), [TFI](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tfi_trawl_filling_indicator), [TPC](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tpc_trawl_position_cartesian_coordinates), [TPR](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tpr_trawl_position_relative_vessel), and [TPT](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tpt_trawl_position_true)
- This list ignores [engine data](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-1415AAD0-FE63-42A6-8F8D-DB713D616122/EN-US/GUID-8C9B7F1D-846C-4FE3-A78C-65D38F17D2D2.html) in NMEA 2000 and the [RPM](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_rpm_revolutions) sentence in NMEA 0183
